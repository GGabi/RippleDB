# Aims:

## **Import and Go**
Allow users to set-up a fully-functional graph database with just a few lines of code.
## **Seems Functional**
Provide all of the features a developer would come to expect from a database.
## **Seems Practical**
Be developed to a standard that users expect of libraries intended for tackling real problems in production.
## **Lightning Fast**
Bless you with all the performance benefits that come with implementing something in Rust.
