# Our Features:

## **Import and Go**
To set up a database simply import RippleDB and call `Graph::new()`

## **Bit-Level Compression**
Graphs vertically-partition their data into slices, represented as bit-matrices, which are then compressed using a data-structure specifically designed for compressing sparse bit-matrices: the [K2Tree](http://swp.dcc.uchile.cl/TR/2009/TR_DCC-20090429-005.pdf).

## **All the K2Trees!**
RippleDB's K2Tree implementation is completely standalone, so use `ripple_db::K2Tree` in other projects to your heart's content!

## **Comprehensive Interface**
All the database-operations you would expect are present:
- `insert_triple`
- `remove_triple`
- `get`
- `persist_to` (the filesystem)
- `from_backup`
- `from_rdf`
- `to_rdf`
- `iter` (iterate over contents)

## **Fancy Types**
RDF nodes can be complex, which is why we made them easy. Graphs accept RdfTriples composed of easily definable RdfNodes:
- Need a named-node? `RdfNode::Named` has got you covered
- Fancy a blank-node? `RdfNode::Blank`'s here for you
- Feeling German? `RdfNode::LangTaggedLit` sagt hallo!
- etc.

## **Even Fancier Queries**
SPARQL queries can be created thusly:

{% highlight rust %}

let q = SparqlQuery::new()
  .select(["$name"])
  .filter([
    ["$name", "born in", "1991"],
    ["$name", "speaks", "Twi"],
    ["RippleDB", "is perfect for", "$name"],
]);

{% endhighlight %}

## **Parallel Concurrency**
When Graph's are built from existing RDF datasets they are done so concurrently over multiple threads for that sweet, sweet speed without tanking your system.
(Don't forget to build with --release!)
