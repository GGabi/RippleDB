# Our Vision

## **Import and Go**
Set-up a fully-functional graph database with just a few lines of code

## **Seems Functional**
Provide all of the features a developer would come to expect from a database

## **Seems Practical**
Developed to a standard that users expect of libraries intended for tackling real problems in production

## **Lightning Fast**
Bless you with all the performance benefits that come with implementing something in Rust
